2. Your build history has been notified to builds@codemanship.com so I can see how often you committed and whether you broke the build
3. Your code passes all of the customer tests provided in the original skeleton solution
4. Your source code (the code in the ProNet project) passes CodeCraft.FxCop code inspection, with no more than 3 uses of SuppressMessage to document any compromises
5. Your source code (the code in the ProNet project) contains no more than 10% duplicated lines of code, as reported by Simian (see instructions PDF)
6. Your test code (the code in the ProNet.Test project) contains no more than 20% duplicated lines of code, as reported by Simian (see instructions PDF)
